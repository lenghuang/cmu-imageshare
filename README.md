# CMU Image Share

Deployed Website: (https://lenghuang.github.io/cmu-imageshare)

Starting off as an idea from _CMU SCS First Year Advisor **Veronica Peet**_ (yay!) to foster a sense of community in the time of COVID-19, this web app allows anyone to upload images in a gallery for you friends to view **:-)**

## The How

#### Front End
These are some of the tools I used to assist me with creating the front end for this website:
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React Boostrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)
- [React Image Gallery](https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery)

#### Back End
To implement the back end of this web app, I am using Google Firebase to:
- Store photos onto a storge bucket (Storage)
- Host image text data (Realtime Database)
